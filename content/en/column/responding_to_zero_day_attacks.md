üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, traditional signature-based detection methods alone are no longer sufficient. **Zero-day attacks** and **unknown attacks** are executed using methods not yet recognized by security systems, making them highly likely to bypass conventional defenses. To effectively block these threats, **anomaly detection based on full web log analysis** is essential.

## What Are Zero-Day and Unknown Attacks?

### 1) What is a Zero-Day Attack?
A **zero-day attack** exploits security vulnerabilities before they are publicly disclosed or patched. These attacks use unknown flaws, making them difficult to detect using conventional security solutions.

### 2) What is an Unknown Attack?
An **unknown attack** refers to previously unseen or undocumented methods. Attackers exploit these gaps, bypassing existing detection systems.

#### üîç Response Methods
- **Behavior Analysis**: Detects abnormal request patterns that differ from typical traffic.
- **Machine Learning Detection**: Compares new behaviors with historical data to identify potential threats.
- **Zero Trust Model**: Continuously verifies all access and blocks suspicious actions.
- **Full Web Log Analysis**: Identifies anomalies by analyzing patterns across sequences of requests‚Äînot just individual events.
- **Suspicious Parameter and POST Body Inspection**: Detects abnormal or malicious values in request payloads.
- **Automated Threat Intelligence Integration**: Leverages real-time global threat data to respond to the latest attack techniques.

## üåê Why Full Web Log Analysis Is Crucial

### 1) Analyzing the Entire Request Flow
Individual HTTP requests may appear normal, but the overall pattern can reveal abnormal behavior.
- **Example**: If a single user attempts thousands of logins in a short time, it's likely a credential stuffing attack.

### 2) Detecting Web Shell Uploads
Attackers may upload malicious scripts to the server and execute them to escalate the attack. Log analysis can help trace the upload and execution of web shells.

### 3) Detecting Parameter Tampering
Attackers modify URLs, request bodies, or cookie values to gain unauthorized access or manipulate functions.
- **Example**: Altering price values on a payment page or elevating privileges to access admin features.

### 4) Detecting API Abuse
Bots and attackers often exploit APIs by sending massive requests or accessing unauthorized data. Web log analysis can reveal these abnormal behaviors early.

### 5) Early Detection of DDoS Attacks
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve flooding servers with requests from multiple IPs. Monitoring full web logs helps identify unusual traffic surges and respond promptly.

## üõ°Ô∏è Strengthening Security Through Real-Time Log Analysis

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**  
   - Automatically blocks suspicious access by monitoring web traffic in real time.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Integration with SIEM Systems**  
   - Automatically analyzes and responds to logs through integration with solutions like PLURA-XDR.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **MITRE ATT&CK Framework-Based Analysis**  
   - Uses threat intelligence based on adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Automated Security Policies**  
   - Automatically blocks suspicious IPs or User-Agents with pre-defined policies.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Conclusion

To effectively defend against zero-day and unknown attacks, organizations must move beyond simple signature-based detection and adopt **anomaly detection powered by comprehensive web log analysis**.

In today‚Äôs cybersecurity landscape, **real-time data analysis and threat intelligence** are essential. By combining continuous log monitoring with machine learning-based detection, businesses can build a stronger, more proactive defense strategy.
