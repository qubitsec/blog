## ‚ÄúInvisible hacking threats could be happening right now.‚Äù

Hacking doesn‚Äôt usually happen all at once.  
üîì It often penetrates quietly and deeply, likely **unnoticed somewhere inside your system**.

- A hacker might have **already installed a backdoor**.  
- Someone might be stealing your data at this very moment.  
- The real problem is that **you may not even know it's happening**.

## ‚ÄúIs an attack happening right now?‚Äù You must be able to answer this question

The most important starting point for security is **situational awareness**.  
Yet many security systems **fail to show what‚Äôs happening in real time**.

- Logs accumulate, but **analysis is slow**.  
- Even when detected, **response is manual**.  
- Detection coverage is limited, and confirming whether an attack is in progress can take **several hours or even days**.

With this kind of approach, it‚Äôs virtually impossible to detect **APT attacks**, **fileless attacks**, or **backdoor installations** in real time.

## PLURA-XDR is ready in just 1 minute

PLURA-XDR focuses on the essence of security:  
**‚ÄúYou must be able to detect if an attack is happening and immediately block it‚Äîautomatically.‚Äù**  
This obvious yet difficult challenge is now reality.

- **Detection**: Real-time analysis of logs, processes, files, networks, and more to identify suspicious activity within one minute  
- **Analysis**: Advanced threat recognition through correlation and pattern analysis, not just isolated events  
- **Response**: When hacker activity is detected, automatic **isolation and blocking** are triggered  
- **Forensics**: Automatically follows up with evidence collection and backdoor trace analysis

In just one minute, PLURA-XDR completes detection, blocking, and response.

## üîç Why automatic defense works within 1 minute

1. **Real-time Event Monitoring**  
   - PLURA-XDR captures every event occurring on servers and networks‚Äîsuch as processes, file creations/changes, and external connections‚Äî**on a per-second basis**.  
   - Through **automated correlation analysis**, alerts are instantly triggered once anomaly thresholds are breached.

2. **Correlation-Based Threat Intelligence**  
   - Going beyond simple signature matching, PLURA-XDR cross-analyzes various logs such as **process activities, network traffic, and file integrity** to grasp overall attack indicators.  
   - Correlation enables identification of **intelligent attack patterns**, even spotting previously unknown threats.

3. **Predefined Auto-Response Scenarios**  
   - For example, ‚ÄúIf suspicious activity is detected under certain conditions, immediately block network access.‚Äù  
     - With predefined **auto-defense rules**, protection mechanisms are triggered without human intervention.  
   - Thanks to this automation, **attacks can be blocked in under 1 minute**.

## üí° Real-World Implementation Cases

### Case A: SQL Injection Attack ‚Üí Automatic Blocking with PLURA-XDR

#### Company A's Concerns  
- Despite long-standing preparations for SQL injection, hackers‚Äô techniques are becoming more sophisticated.  
- Attacks occur regardless of domestic or overseas IPs, often targeting vulnerable hours like weekends or early mornings.  
- Even with 24/7 monitoring services outsourced to professionals, **immediate blocking** was difficult.  
- Operating an in-house 365-day monitoring team was **unfeasible due to cost and staffing**.

#### Response Strategy  
- A single successful **SQL injection** could lead to mass leakage of customer or confidential information.  
- As hackers use **various evasion techniques**, relying solely on pattern matching had limitations.  
- **PLURA-XDR** blocks the IP instantly upon detecting **even a single attack attempt**, swiftly defending against irregular patterns.  
- Combined with PLURA's **24/7 CERT (Security Monitoring) service**, additional intrusion or variant attacks can be **monitored and blocked in real time**.

#### Implementation Effect  
- Previously, countermeasures were only attempted **after an attack was noticed**,  
- But with **PLURA-XDR**, **blocking, isolation, and report generation are completed before security personnel even arrive at work**.  
- As a result, **zero data breach incidents** were achieved, significantly reducing weekend and holiday security gaps.

### Case B: APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) ‚Üí Behavior-Based Detection

#### Company B's Concerns  
- Systems frequently experienced **failures due to CPU overload**, continuously exposing them to threats.  
- Investigations failed to determine the **exact root cause** of the CPU load.  
- Various antivirus solutions were tried but failed to detect the issue.  
- Reinstalling the system posed **too much risk**, making actual implementation difficult.  
- System failures on weekends required security staff to **rush into work repeatedly**.

#### Response Strategy  
- Modern APT attacks often **don‚Äôt use known malware**.  
- Script-based attacks using **PowerShell**, for example, are hard for antivirus software to detect.  
- **PLURA-XDR** detects abnormal behavior by comprehensively analyzing **malware activities** such as processes, files, and networks.  
- Based on the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework, detection results are presented using **6W1H**, enabling security personnel to clearly understand the cause and respond quickly.

#### Implementation Effect  
- In the past, even after detecting signs of an attack, **response was delayed**.  
- After implementing **PLURA-XDR**, **blocking and isolation were completed before work hours**, and reports were automatically generated.  
- By resolving weekend and holiday security gaps, system failures were minimized and **data breaches were prevented**.

## Now Is the Time for Automated Response

Hackers operate with automated attack tools‚Äî  
Are we still manually checking logs and responding by hand?

**PLURA-XDR begins its response even before a human notices.**

- Backdoor installation detection  
- Blocking unknown external connections  
- Tracing suspicious processes disguised as normal ones  

All of these processes are handled **in real time without human intervention**.

## Don‚Äôt Wait Any Longer

Hacking doesn‚Äôt explode suddenly‚Äî  
It **quietly infiltrates and then erupts** unexpectedly.

This very moment might be the **peak of an attack**.  
The most important thing is to clearly understand **‚Äúwhat is happening right now.‚Äù**

üåê [**PLURA-XDR**](https://www.plura.io)  
**faster and more automated than anyone else**,  
lets you know **whether an intrusion is happening at this very moment.**
