## üé¨ Famous Quote from *The Imitation Game*

> ‚Äú**Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.**‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúIt is often those who are least expected who accomplish the unimaginable.‚Äù

This is one of the most memorable lines from the movie **The Imitation Game**, which portrays the story of the genius mathematician **Alan Mathison Turing**.  
He deciphered the **Enigma code**, which was thought to be unbreakable, and changed the course of World War II.

## ‚ùå Clear Limitations of Existing Security Products

Despite the abundance of security solutions, most suffer from the following critical flaws:

- They only **respond to known attacks**.  
- They **lack sufficient logs to analyze**.  
- Ultimately, they become **systems incapable of reacting to actual incidents**.

---

## ‚úÖ PLURA Has Done the Unthinkable

**PLURA** focuses on **logs**, the *First Principle* of cybersecurity.

> **‚ÄúIf logs exist, all responses are possible.‚Äù**

However, the problem is that **most companies do not have those logs**.

- OS-level logs are often not generated by default.  
- Most organizations do not collect full **web request and response bodies**.

**PLURA** solves this problem.

- It **enables log generation** on the OS via **Audit Policy**.  
- It **collects full web request/response content**, creating an **environment for real-time analysis**.  
- It offers **instant search and analysis** from a centralized log repository.

## ‚ö° Real-Time Analysis and Automated Response

PLURA is not limited to detection. It enables:

- **Real-time attack detection** based on logs  
- **Intelligent threat identification** through correlation analysis  
- **Immediate response** by integrating with **EDR and WAF**

Gone are the days of discovering an attack after it happens.  
**PLURA detects and responds instantly.**

## üèÅ Conclusion

> ‚Äú**Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.**‚Äù

**PLURA** is not just a security solution.  
It is a product that **focuses on the essence of security** and brings innovation beyond existing paradigms into reality.

We are doing what no one else has done.
